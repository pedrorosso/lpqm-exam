# Solutions to the LPQM exam

This repository contains the solutions to application of Pedro Rosso Gomez, each folder with the answer to a different problem.

All calculations are implemented in python3. The required libraries can be installed using pip or conda (check requirements.txt for the required libraries.)

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
or
```
conda install --file requirements.txt
```

The written solutions are either in Markdown or Jupyter notebooks. I recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the Markdown and python extensions for the whole project.
